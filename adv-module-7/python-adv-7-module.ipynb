    "Notice in the simulation that there is a non-zero probability density that appears to the right of the potential barrier. We refer to this as quantum tunneling. Allow me to make some remarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**\\[Optional remarks\\]**: In quantum mechanics courses, the issue of tunneling is often treated in the case where a plane wave travels towards a potential barrier. Solving for solutions to the time-independent Schrödinger equation, the energy eigenstate has a non-zero probability density to the right of the potential. However, this example is not physical because a plane wave is not normalizable. In other words, the wave function can never actually be a plane wave. Coherent states *are* physical states (that are linear combinations of plane waves); hence, our simulation is more realistic in this respect.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, a coherent state is not a energy eigenstate. This begs the question: what does it mean to say the particle has tunneled? In the case of a plane wave with energy eigenvalue E, if E$<V_h$ (the height of the barrier), we say that a classical particle with similar energy can not be observed on the other side of the barrier---hence the quantum particle must have tunneled through. (Although...we must be careful even with this analogy: when we measure the position of the particle, the wave function is projected onto a state that is no longer an energy eigenstate.)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is difficult to find such an analogy for a coherent state. Perhaps we can define E, the energy of the particle in the classical limit, as $\\langle p\\rangle^2/2$. But we can find $\\psi_0(x)$ to have larger values of momentum than $\\langle p\\rangle$ with relatively large probabilities, so this is not entirely convincing. Perhaps $E = p_\\text{max}^2/2$ where $p_\\text{max}$ is the maximum value of momentum we can measure $\\psi_0(x)$. But, the momentum space wave function of a Gaussian (e.g. the coherent state with $\\langle x\\rangle = \\langle p\\rangle=0$) is Gaussian, so $p_\\text{max}$ is unbounded and tunneling is not classically forbidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps these two arguments taken together give us the most sensible interpretation: in the classical limit, we might expect the distribution of momentum to approach $\\langle p\\rangle$ and $\\Delta p$ to approach 0. Therefore, if $\\langle p\\rangle^2/2<V_h$, the probability of measuring the particle to be in a sufficiently large momentum state ($p^2/2>V_h$) approaches zero: *tunneling is clasically allowed, but highly improbable*. On the length and energy scales of an electron, tunneling is a common affair; but on human scales, the probability is non-zero, but so small as to be forbidden for all intents and purposes."
